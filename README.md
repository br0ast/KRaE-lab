# Knowledge Representation and Extraction Laboratory

## Introduction

KRaE-Lab will be a practical take on the lessons of the [Knowledge Representation and Extraction](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2020/454463) course of the [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge) Master Degree of the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). It will be held by [Bruno Sartini](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/bruno.sartini3/), PhD Student and Tutor of the DHDK course.

The aim of the laboratory is to make students familiarize with techniques of knowledge extraction and representation. It will include insights on SPARQL language, management of data and conversion of data from machine-readable formats such as json or csv to linked open data versions. Practical examples on how to construct, analyze and query graphs will be given along with an introduction on how to develop an Ontology.

The lessons will be held using the [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/microsoft-teams/log-in) Software.

The whole content of the lab will be found in the website https://br0ast.github.io/KRaE-lab/

## Required Knowledge

* basic knowledge of what an RDF is
* basic knowledge of the formats you can use to encode Linked open data
* basic knowledge of python (libraries and platforms will be explained during the laboratory

*Note: if you are not a student of the DHDK master degree and you plan to follow this course only*
*you can acquire basic knowledge of the subjects above by looking at the materials/slides of the [Computational Thinking and Programming](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2020/424624) course and [Knowledge Organization and Cultural Heritage](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2020/454462) course.*

## Required Materials

* The free software [protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) will be used during the laboratory.
* [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/microsoft-teams/log-in) will be used to broadcast the lessons.
* A browser will be used to access [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and the various SPARQL endpoints that will be queried.

## Lessons Content

### Lesson 1: Wikipedia-based Ontology Induction

A frontal lesson on how to semi-automatically develop a domain-specific ontology by extracting, re-engineering the knowledge on DBpedia and Wikidata

### Lesson 2: From Open Data to Linked Open Data: bottom-up approach to ontology development

A participative lesson on how to transform open data into linked open data and how to develop your ontology starting from data. Students will be divided into groups and at the end of the lesson will present their work.

### Lesson 3: Theory-based ontology deduction

A participative lesson on how to develop an ontology starting from a specific theory of the interested domain. Students will be divided into groups and at the end of the lesson will present their work.

### Lesson 4: Semantic virtual curation pt.1

A participative lesson in which students will be asked to develop a semantic virtual curation.

### Lesson 5: Semantic virtual curation pt.2

Second part of the lesson based on a semantic virtual curation. At the end of the lesson students will present their work on their semantic virtual curation.
