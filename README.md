# Knowledge Representation and Extraction Laboratory

## Introduction

KRaE-Lab will be a practical take on the lessons of the [Knowledge Representation and Extraction](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2020/454463) course of the [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge) Master Degree of the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). It will be held by [Bruno Sartini](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/bruno.sartini3/), PhD Student and Tutor of the DHDK course.

The aim of the laboratory is to make students familiarize with techniques of knowledge extraction and representation. It will include insights on SPARQL language, management of data and conversion of data from machine-readable formats such as json or csv to linked open data versions. Practical examples on how to construct, analyze and query graphs will be given along with an introduction on how to develop an Ontology.

The lessons will be held using the [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/microsoft-teams/log-in) Software.
