# Assignment

Today you will be asked to develop an ontology using the bottom up approach. You'll start from the data in a json format, and have to do the following things.


***

## First Look

Look at the data, try to imagine possible classes and properties that emerge from the data

***

## Develop Competency Questions

By looking at the data, come up with **at least** 3 competency questions. Try to create simple and complex competency questions.

Also try to check what would be the answers to your competency questions if applied to your data.

***

## Take another look at the first conceptualization

See if your conceptualization "theoretically" can answer those competency questions

***

## Start developing the TBOX

Use Protégé to formalized the defined classes, properties and data properties conceptualized before. Pay attention to range and domain! Choose a prefix for the ontology

***

## Create the ABOX

Encode the data that you've worked on at the beginning using your ontology. You can do that manually or re-adapt the algorithm that I have given you during the class. 
**No need to clean the data, it should be clean**

***

## Formalize the competency questions

Create the SPARQL version of your competency questions based on your ontology using the algorithm I have given you during the class. Check whether the results you obtained are the same as the expected results.
